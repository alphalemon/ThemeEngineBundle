How to fix genrated themes
--------------------------

If you used the themes generator, you'd probably run in troubles with it if suffixed you theme 
with the ThemeBundle suffix, ie FancyThemeBundle.

Since Beta5 release that was fixed, but to have your theme, generated with a previous version, to work,
please follow these steps:

1. Remove the Resources/config/templates folder from your FancyThemeBundle
2. Backup or remove the FancyThemeExtension.php file under the DependencyInjection folder
3. Rename the generated theme config file, saved under the Resources/config adding the _theme suffix.
   
4. Open the theme config file 

        <service id="fancy.theme" class="%alpha_lemon_theme_engine.theme.class%">
            <argument type="string">Fancy</argument>
            <tag name="alpha_lemon_theme_engine.themes.theme" />
        </service>

   and change it as follows:

        <service id="fancy_theme.theme" class="%alpha_lemon_theme_engine.theme.class%">
            <argument type="string">FancyTheme</argument>
            <tag name="alpha_lemon_theme_engine.themes.theme" />
        </service>

So the id must get the _theme suffix and the argument passed to the service must get the Theme suffix
